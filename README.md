# CarSO-website

## What is this? 

It's selected snippets of CSS/HTML used to maintain the CarSO website at scioly.web.unc.edu.

## Why host it on Github?

Actually, we don't really need to, but due to the limited version control available via WordPress, Github provides a good backup. Furthermore, as CarSO will likely be growing in the future, it may be important for future webmasters to access and collaborate on the design of a website on a platform with version control, to prevent the website from going amok.

## Why make a readme?

I created a README so that Github would stop bothering me about it.
