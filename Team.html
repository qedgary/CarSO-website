            Hi! I'm a linguistics and physics double major from Indiana. I write a lot for Sounds of Music, and it's always an honor to work with students who infuse passion into Science Olympiad. My favorite books include <em>The Disappearing Spoon</em> by Sam Kean and <em>The Drunkard's Walk</em> by Leonard Mlodinow. I enjoy science communication, because science is for everybody! Blah blah blah, some text to fill up space. Yadda yadda. Here is some text to test hy­phe­na­tion, hy­phe­na­tion, and more hy­phe­na­tion bey­ond hy­phe­na­tion. Someday, I'll eventually figure out classical mechanics.</div>
    </div>

<!--
These empty placeholder div are only here to take up space. We need these because exec board containers are center-aligned, so without invisible placeholder elements, the last few elements may be in an ugly arrangement.

For example, if there are 7 exec board biographies, and the screen fits only two biographies per row, then this is how placeholders make a difference:

    no placeholders     with placeholders
       +-------+            +-------+
       | Meet  |            | Meet  |
       | the   |            | the   |
       | Team  |            | Team  |
       |       |            |       |            
       | X   X |            | X   X |
       | X   X |            | X   X |
       | X   X |            | X   X |
       |   X   |            | X     |
       +-------+            +-------+

Technically, we don't even need a placeholder class, as long as the <div class='exec-container'></div> is made with nothing inside it. The result is still the same. This just makes it abundantly clear why these exist.
