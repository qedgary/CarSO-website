            Hey! My name is Amil and I’m from Matthews, North Carolina. I’ve competed in Science Olympiad before and am excited to be working with everyone else to host an invitational for middle and high school teams! In my spare time, I like to read sci-fi, ride my bike, photograph nature, and go on long walks in the rain/snow. A fun fact about me is that I’ve hiked the entirety of Blue Ridge Parkway, and have hiked on nearly every mountain range in the state of North Carolina.

<!--
These empty placeholder div are only here to take up space. We need these because exec board containers are center-aligned, so without invisible placeholder elements, the last few elements may be in an ugly arrangement.

For example, if there are 7 exec board biographies, and the screen fits only two biographies per row, then this is how placeholders make a difference:

    no placeholders     with placeholders
       +-------+            +-------+
       | Meet  |            | Meet  |
       | the   |            | the   |
       | Team  |            | Team  |
       |       |            |       |            
       | X   X |            | X   X |
       | X   X |            | X   X |
       | X   X |            | X   X |
       |   X   |            | X     |
       +-------+            +-------+

Technically, we don't even need a placeholder class, as long as the <div class='exec-container'></div> is made with nothing inside it. The result is still the same. This just makes it abundantly clear why these exist.
