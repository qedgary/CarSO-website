         <strong>Carmel High School</strong>
         Hi! I'm a linguistics and physics double major from Indiana. I write a lot for Sounds of Music, and it's always an honor to work with students who infuse passion into Science Olympiad. My favorite books include <em>The Disappearing Spoon</em> by Sam Kean and <em>The Drunkard's Walk</em> by Leonard Mlodinow. I enjoy science communication, because science is for everybody! Blah blah blah, some text to fill up space. Yadda yadda. Here is some text to test hy&shy;phe&shy;na&shy;tion, hy&shy;phe&shy;na&shy;tion, and more hy&shy;phe&shy;na&shy;tion bey&shy;ond hy&shy;phe&shy;na&shy;tion. Someday, I'll eventually figure out classical mechanics.</div>
