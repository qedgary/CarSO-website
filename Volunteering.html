<h4><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Be the one who helps educate the next cohort of STEM leaders.</strong></h4>
Volunteers are lifesavers who keep our operations afloat. If you're interested in volunteering with us, we'd love to have you help out! We also partner with other organizations across the state and nation to help volunteers like you make an impact wherever STEM needs you most.

Whether it's mentoring a current Science Olympiad team or helping out at an official tournament, or an idea of your own, please let us know what you're interested in, and we'll gladly help to connect you to volunteer opportunities.
